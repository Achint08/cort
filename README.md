# cort v03

This branch contains a version of __cort__ that will replace the current version. Its main features are more models and a better train/dev/test workflow. Due to missing documentation the code is not yet ready to replace the current version of __cort__. However, the scripts in the main directory can be used to replicate the results from my PhD thesis (Martschat (2017)). If you have any questions, please write me a mail.
