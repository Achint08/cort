# cort

__cort__ is a <b>co</b>reference <b>r</b>esolution <b>t</b>oolkit. It consists
of two parts: the *coreference resolution* component implements a framework for 
coreference resolution based on latent variables, which allows you to rapidly 
devise approaches to coreference resolution, while the *error analysis* component 
provides extensive functionality for analyzing and visualizing errors made by 
coreference resolution systems.

* <a href="ANALYSIS.md">error analysis with cort</a>
* <a href="MULTIGRAPH.md">running the multigraph system</a>

## Installation

__cort__ is available on PyPi. You can install it via

```
pip install cort
```
Dependencies (automatically installed by pip) are 
[nltk](http://www.nltk.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), 
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), 
[mmh3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mmh3),
[cython](http://cython.org/),
[future](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future),
[jpype](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jpype1) and
[beautifulsoup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). It ships with 
[PyStanfordDependencies](https://github.com/dmcc/PyStanfordDependencies),
[stanford_corenlp_pywrapper](https://github.com/brendano/stanford_corenlp_pywrapper)
and [the reference implementation of the CoNLL scorer]
(https://github.com/conll/reference-coreference-scorers).

__cort__ is written for use on Linux with either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+.
However, I recommend running __cort__ with Python 3, since the Python 3 version is 
more efficient.
